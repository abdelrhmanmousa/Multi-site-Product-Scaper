An automated web scraper designed to gather product data for used electronics from multiple online marketplaces in Egypt. It uses Selenium to control a web browser and BeautifulSoup to parse HTML, consolidating all findings into a single, structured JSON file.
‚ú® Features
Multi-Site Scraping: Simultaneously scrapes data from Dubizzle and OpenSooq.
Modular Design: Each scraper is a separate class, making it easy to maintain or add new sites.
Anti-Detection Measures: Implements user-agent rotation and other Selenium best practices to minimize the chance of being blocked.
Structured Output: Saves all scraped data in a clean, unified JSON format.
Configurable: Easily change search queries and the number of pages to scrape.

üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è How to Run the Script
Configure your search:
Open the main script file (e.g., scraper.py) and navigate to the if __name__ == "__main__": block at the bottom. You can customize two key variables:
search_queries: A list of product names you want to search for.
pages_to_scrape: The number of search result pages to process for each query.
code
Python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # ---== CONFIGURE YOUR SCRAPE HERE ==---
    search_queries = ["iphone 13", "samsung s22", "pixel 6"]
    PAGES_TO_SCRAPE_PER_QUERY = 2
    # ---==============================---

    # (The rest of the script)
    # ...
    for query in search_queries:
        urls = scraper_instance.get_all_product_urls(query, pages_to_scrape=PAGES_TO_SCRAPE_PER_QUERY)
        # ...
Execute the script:
Run the script from your terminal (with the virtual environment activated).
code
Bash
python your_script_name.py
The script will print its progress to the console.
üìÑ Output
After the script finishes, it will generate a final_scraped_data.json file in the root directory. This file contains a list of all the products found, with each product represented as a JSON object.
